11:30  need to pay for mp.by and check card balance (#19)
11:50  reading how to store credit card info (PCI Data Storage)
11:55  can store first 6 and last 4 numbers for bank card
12:00  writing card balance getter in Python
13:05  card balance done

```
>>> from cards import balance
>>> balance()
EUR 3.0
USD 136.1
>>>
```
13:35  checked card balance and opened (#20)
14:15  paid for mp.by (#19) 50.40 BYN to domain.by thru paysec.by
       with 6141. Got 26.5 USD withdrawn, which is 50.403 BYN using
       1.9020 Priorbank card conversion rate
14:45  tried to figure out where 0.003 BYN comes from, payment
       to bank came from domain.by, sum exacly 50.40, so it must be
       rounding mistakes
